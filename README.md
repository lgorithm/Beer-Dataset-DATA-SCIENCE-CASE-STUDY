## Beer Dataset Analysis and Modeling

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a beer dataset, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model training. The project evaluates multiple models to identify the most accurate classifier for predicting beer-related attributes.


## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a beer dataset to extract insights and build predictive models. The workflow includes:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to understand patterns, distributions, and relationships between features.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating and selecting relevant features for the machine learning models.

4. **Model Training**: Implementing and comparing various machine learning models to achieve optimal accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Analyzing model performance metrics and selecting the best-performing model.


## Key Features

**1. Dataset Exploration:** Detailed EDA to uncover key insights about the dataset.

**2. Machine Learning Models:** Evaluation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Trees (DT).

**3. Performance Comparison:** Visualization of model accuracies for easy interpretation.

**4.Visualizations:** High-quality plots to illustrate findings and results.
